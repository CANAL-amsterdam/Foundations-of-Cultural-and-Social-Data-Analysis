        "1. The dataset provides information about the dimensions of most artworks in the\n",
        "   collection (expressed in millimeters). Compute the mean and median width (column `width`), height (column\n",
        "   `height`), and total size (i.e., the length times the height) of the artworks. Is the\n",
        "   median a better guess than the mean for this sample of artworks?\n",
        "2. Draw histograms for the width, height, and size of the artworks. Why would it make sense\n",
        "   to take the logarithm of the data before plotting?\n",
        "3. Compute the *range* of the width and height in the collection. Do you think the range\n",
        "   is an appropriate measure of dispersion for these data? Explain why you think it is or\n",
        "   isn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Moderate\n",
        "1. With the advent of postmodernism, the sizes of the artworks became more varied and\n",
        "   extreme. Make a scatter plot of the artworks' size (Y axis) over time (X axis). Add a\n",

        "   (Hint: use the column `year`, convert the data to a logarithmic scale for better\n",

        "   plot.)\n",
        "2. To obtain a better understanding of the changes in size over time, create two box plots\n",
        "   which summarize the distributions of the artwork sizes from before and\n",
        "   after 1950. Explain the different components of the box plots. How do the two box plots\n",
        "   relate to the scatter plot in the previous exercise?\n",
        "3. In this exercise, we will create an alternative visualization of the changes in shapes\n",

        "1. The `artist` column provides the name of the artist of each artwork in the\n",

        "   will investigate the diversity of the Tate collection in terms of its artists. First,\n",
        "   compute the entropy of the artist frequencies in the entire collection. Then, compute\n",
        "   and compare the entropy for artworks from before and after 1950. Describe and interpret\n",
        "   your results.\n",
        "2. For most of the artworks in the collection, the metadata provides information about\n",
        "   what subjects are depicted. This information is stored in the column `subject`. Works\n",
        "   of art can be assigned to one or more categories, such as \"nature\", \"literature and\n",
        "   fiction\", and \"work and occupations\". In this exercise we investigate the associations\n",
        "   and dependence between some of the categories. First calculate the mutual information\n",
        "   between the categories \"emotions\" and \"concepts and ideas\". What does the relatively\n",
        "   high mutual information score mean for these concepts? Next, compute the mutual\n",
        "   information between \"nature\" and \"abstraction\". How should we interpret the information\n",
        "   score between these categories? (Hint: to compute the mutual information between\n",
        "   categories, it might be useful to first convert the data into a document-term matrix.)\n",
