    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reload the names dataset (`data/names.csv`) with the year column as index. What is the\n",
    "   total number of rows?\n",
    "2. Print the number of rows for boy names and the number of rows for girl names.\n",
    "3. The method `Series.value_counts()` computes a count of the unique values in a `Series`\n",
    "   object. Use this function to find out whether there are more distinct male or more\n",
    "   distinct female names in the dataset.\n",
    "4. Find out how many distinct female names have a cumulative frequency higher than 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moderate\n",
    "1. In section {ref}`sec-working-with-data-name-ending-bias`, we analyzed a bias in boys'\n",
    "   names ending in the letter *n*. Repeat that analysis for girls' names. Do you observe any\n",
    "   noteworthy trends?\n",
    "2. Some names have been used for a long time. In this exercise we investigate which names\n",
    "   were used both now and in the past. Write a function called `timespan()`, which takes a\n",
    "   `Series` object as argument and returns the difference between the `Series`' maximum and\n",
    "   minimum value (i.e. `max(x) - min(x)`). Apply this function to each unique name in the\n",
    "   dataset, and print the five names with the longest timespan. (Hint: use `groupby()`,\n",
    "   `apply()`, and `sort_values()`).\n",
    "3. Compute the mean and maximum female and male name length (in characters) per year. Plot\n",
    "   your results and comment on your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenging\n",
    "1. Write a function which counts the number of vowel characters in a string. Which names have eight\n",
    "   vowel characters in them? (Hint: use the function you wrote in combination with the `apply()`\n",
    "   method.) For the sake of simplicity, you may assume that the following characters unambiguously represent vowel characters: `{'e', 'i', 'a', 'o', 'u', 'y'}`.\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean usage in vowel characters in male names and female names in the entire\n",
    "   dataset. Which gender is associated with higher average vowel usage? Do you\n",
    "   think the difference counts as considerable? Try plotting the mean vowel usage over\n",
    "   time. For this exercise, you do not have to worry about unisex names: if a name, for instance, occurs once as a female name and once as a male name, you may simply count it twice, i.e., once in each category.\n",
    "3. Some initials are more productive than others and have generated a large number of\n",
    "   distinct first names. In this exercise, we will visualize the differences in name\n",
    "   generating productivity between initials.[^creditsbh] Create a scatter plot with dots for each\n",
    "   distinct initial in the data (give points of girl names a different color than points\n",
    "   of boy names). The Y-axis represents the total number of distinct names, and the X-axis\n",
    "   represents the number of people carrying a name with a particular initial. In addition\n",
    "   to simple dots, we would like to label each point with its corresponding initial. Use the\n",
    "   function `plt.annotate()` to do that. Next, create two subplots using `plt.subplots()` and\n",
    "   draw a similar scatter plot for the period between 1900 and 1920, and one for the\n",
    "   period between 1980 and 2000. Do you observe any differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "[^creditsbh]: This exercise was inspired by a blog post by Gerrit Bloothooft and David Onland\n",
