        "2. Using the same \"region\" column, produce a frequency distribution of the regions in the\n",
        "   data.\n",
        "3. Create a bar plot of the different regions annotated in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Moderate\n",
        "1. Use the function `plot_trend()` to create a time series plot for three or more ingredients of your\n",
        "   own choice.\n",
        "2. Go back to section `Taste Trends in Culinary US History`. Create a bar plot of\n",
        "   the ten most distinctive ingredients for the pre- and postwar era using as keyness\n",
        "   measure the Pearson's $\\chi^2$ test statistic.\n",
        "3. With the invention of baking powder, cooking efficiency went up. Could there be a\n",
        "   relationship between the increased use of baking powder and the number of recipes\n",
        "   describing cakes, sweets, and bread? (The latter recipes have the value `\"breadsweets\"`\n",
        "   in the `recipe_class` column in the original data.) Produce two time series plots: one\n",
        "   for the absolute number of recipes involving baking powder as ingredient, and a second\n",
        "   plotting the absolute number `\"breadsweets\"` recipes over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenging\n",
        "1. Use the code to produce the scatter plot from section\n",
        "   `Taste Trends in Culinary US History`, and experiment with different time frame\n",
        "   settings to find distinctive words for other time periods. For example, can you compare\n",
        "   twentieth-century recipes to nineteenth-century recipes?\n",
        "2. Adapt the scatter plot code from section\n",
        "   `America's Culinary Melting Pot` to find distinctive ingredients for\n",
        "   two specific ethnic groups. (You could, for instance, contrast typical ingredients from\n",
        "   the Jewish cuisine with those from the Creole culinary tradition.) How do these results\n",
        "   differ from the ethnicity plot we created before? (Hint: For this\n",
        "   exercise, you could simply adapt the very final code block of the chapter and use the\n",
        "   somewhat simplified keyness measure proposed there.)\n",
        "3. Use the \"region\" column to create a scatter plot of distinctive ingredients in the\n",
        "   northeast of the United States versus the ingredients used in the midwest. To make\n",
        "   things harder on yourself, you could use Pearson's $\\chi^2$ test statistic as a keyness\n",
        "   measure."
